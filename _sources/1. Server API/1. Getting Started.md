# Getting Started

Glycerine Server provides the API for clients to access and manage resources. Glycerine Workbench also consumes 
Glycerine Server API which means most of things that can be done in Glycerine Workbench can also be done via Glycerine 
Server API.

## Authentication

```{note}
To request an API token, please contact the [support](https://glycerine.io/support/) team.
```

Glycerine Server uses API tokens for external clients to authenticate the requests. The token should be included in the
`Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token. For example, a standard API request header would be like:

```
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {YOUR API TOKEN}
```

## Servers

Australia: `https://iaw-server.ardc-hdcl-sia-iaw.cloud.edu.au/`

International: `https://server.glycerine.io/`

## Usages

The `Accept` header should be specified as `application/json` for each API request. All API endpoints start with URL
prefix `api`. For example:

```
GET https://iaw-server.ardc-hdcl-sia-iaw.cloud.edu.au/api/collections
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {YOUR API TOKEN}
```

## Responses

The responses of API requests are in JSON format if the request header `Accept: application/json` is specified. It
returns HTTP status code `200` if the request is successful. Otherwise, it returns HTTP status code such as `400` or
`500` with the body of the error messages.

```json
{
  "message": "Error message summary",
  "errors": {
    "error 1": [
      "Details about error 1"
    ],
    "error 2": [
      "Details about error 2"
    ]
  }
}
```
