# 2. Authentication

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, API tokens are not opened for public users. To request an API token, please contact the administrator of
> the IAW platform.

IAW Server uses API tokens for external clients to authenticate the requests. The token should be included in the
`Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token. For example, a standard API request header would be like:

```
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {YOUR API TOKEN}
```

##### Arguments

- `email`: The email of the user account.
- `token-name`: A human-readable label of the API token.
