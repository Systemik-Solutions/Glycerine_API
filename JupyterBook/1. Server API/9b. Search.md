# Search

## Search within a collection

```
GET /collections/{collection_id}/search
```

This will search entities from a given collection based on the query parameters from the request URL. The `type`
parameter specifies the type of the entity to search. If multiple values are needed to pass to the same parameter,
concatenate them with a comma or use the array notation. For example, to specify multiple image IDs to search.

Comma separated:

```
GET /collections/{collection_id}/search?type=image&id=1,2,3
```

Array notation, which is useful when values contain commas:

```
GET /collections/{collection_id}/search?type=image&id[]=1&id[]=2&id[]=3
```

The following are a list of supported types:

- `annotation`
- `image`
- `image_set`
- `annotation_set`
- `tag`: The tags applied to the annotations in the collection.

The following lists the supported query parameters.

- `id`: Used for searching entities by ID. Multiple values are supported.
- `full_text`: Used for full text search.
- `tag_label`: Used for searching entities by tag label. Multiple values are supported.

The following table lists the supported query parameters for each type.

| Type               | `id` | `full_text` | `tag_label` |
